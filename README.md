# RED-CNN-MATLAB

This repository updates the testing code for [the Official Implementation](https://github.com/maybe198376/Low-Dose-CT-With-a-Residual-Encoder-Decoder-Convolutional-Neural-Network) of [RED-CNN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7947200/) (Low-Dose CT With a Residual Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network) via [Deep Learning Toolbox Importer for Caffe Models](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61735-deep-learning-toolbox-importer-for-caffe-models) developed by the Official MATLAB MathWorks Deep Learning Toolbox Team, so that we no more need to install Caffe for testing on the provided pretrained model.
